CmdParameter
============

Version 0.1.0

`CmdParameter` is a library for handling command line parameters in C++.

Its goals are:

  - to make it as simple as feasible *for usage*
  - to make it easy to add new parameter types

 Note that these are very different goals from making this a simple class system.
