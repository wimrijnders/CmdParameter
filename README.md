CmdParameter
============

Version 0.1.0

`CmdParameter` is a library for handling command line parameters in C++.

Its goals are:

  - to make it as simple as feasible to define parameters and use them
  - to make it easy to add new parameter types

 Note that these are very different goals from making this simple.
 The downside is that this code becomes more complex. I think this is a worthwhile tradeoff.
